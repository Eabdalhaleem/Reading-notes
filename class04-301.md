# React and Forms

HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name


## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

 In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState()
 We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.


## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

 initially selected, because of the selected attribute. React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag. This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to update it in one place.

 The condition is what you’re actually testing. The result of your condition should be true or false or at least coerce to either boolean value.
 A ? separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.
Finally a : colon. If your condition evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed

## Forms
The <FormControl> component renders a form control with Bootstrap styling. The <FormGroup> component wraps a form control with proper spacing, along with support for a label, help text, and validation state. To ensure accessibility, set controlId on <FormGroup>, and use <FormLabel> for the label.

The <FormControl> component directly renders the <input> or other specified component. If you need to access the value of an uncontrolled <FormControl>, attach a ref to it as you would with an uncontrolled input, then call ReactDOM.findDOMNode(ref) to get the DOM node. You can then interact with that node as you would with any other uncontrolled input.

If your application contains a large number of form groups, we recommend building a higher-level component encapsulating a complete field group that renders the label, the control, and any other necessary components. We don't provide this out-of-the-box, because the composition of those field groups is too specific to an individual application to admit a good one-size-fits-all solution.

## Conditional Rendering

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

## Element Variables
You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn’t change.


## Inline If with Logical && Operator
You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator. It can be handy for conditionally including an element

## Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator
Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator condition ? true : false.

-----

## Preventing Component from Rendering
In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output.

In the example below, the <WarningBanner /> is rendered depending on the value of the prop called warn. If the value of the prop is false, then the component does not render
