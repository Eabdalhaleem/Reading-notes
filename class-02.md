# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions
## Text
HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
X They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)

----
## Heading :
HTML has six "levels" of 
headings:
<h1> is used for main headings
<h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections 
under the subheadings then the 
<h3> element is used, and so 
on...
 ---
 ## paragraphs 
 <p>
To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag.
 ## Bold & Ilitic
 <b>
By enclosing words in the tags 
<b> and </b> we can make 
characters appear **bold**.
The <b> element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
presented in a visually different 
way (for example key words in a 
paragraph) although the use of 
the <b> element does not imply 
any additional meaning.
<i>
By enclosing words in the tags 
<i> and </i> we can make 
characters appear *italic*.
  
  ----
  ## trong & Emphasis
  <em>
The <em> element indicates 
emphasis that subtly changes 
the meaning of a sentence.
<strong>
The use of the <strong>
element indicates that its 
content has strong importance.

# INtroducing CSS :
CSS allows you to create rules that control the 
way that each individual box (and the contents 
of that box) is presented.
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern 
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule 
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two 
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify 
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
 ** Using External CSS **
 <link> chapter-10/using-external-css.html HTML
The <link> element can be used 
in an HTML document to tell the 
browser where to find the CSS 
file used to style the page. 
< link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css"
**Using Internal CSS**
<style>
You can also include CSS rules 
within an HTML page by placing 
them inside a <style> element, 
which usually sits inside the 
<head> element of the page.

 # JS 
 A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 
A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.
When you write JavaScript, you have to tell the
interpreter every individual step that you want it to
perform. This sometimes involves more detail than
you might expect. 

**A variable** is a good name for this
concept because the data stored
in a variable can change (or vary)
each time a script runs.

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans.
Once you have assigned a value
to a variable, you can then
change what is stored in the
variable later in the same script

## CREATING AN ARRAY
You create an array and give it
a name just like you would any
other variable (using the var
keyword followed by the name of
the array)
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

there are two condition :
evaluation condition
condition statment
 you can evalute a sitiuation by comparing one value to what you expect
