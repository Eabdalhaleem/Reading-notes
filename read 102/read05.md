## Loops
i is chech the condition,if it returns true, a code block will run.then the condition will be cheched again if it's true,the code block will run again.
## For :
we use it to run code a specific number of time ,use for loop the condition is usually a counter which is used tell how many time the loop should run.
The for...in statement iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in arbitrary order. For each distinct property, statements can be executed.
## WHILE:
if you dont know how many time the code should run , you can use a while loop,the condition can be something other than a counterto loop the condition is true.
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
 ## Do while:
 similar to while ,but has one key difference always run the the statement ,inside the curly braces at least once ,even if the condition evalutes to fales.
