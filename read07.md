# Css
CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.**CSS** works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

------
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed

-------
*CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.
