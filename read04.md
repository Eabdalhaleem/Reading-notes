CONTENT LAYER
## . html files
This is where the content of
the page lives. The HTML gives
the page structure and adds
semantics.
## the HTML layer
allows you to focus on the most
important thing about your site:
its content.
Being plain HTML, this layer
should work on all kinds of
devices, be accessible to all
users, and load quite quickly on
slow connections 
## PRESENTATION LAYER
. css files
**The CSS** enhances the HTML
page with rules that state how
the HTML content is presented
(backgrounds, borders, box
dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.)
## BEHAVIOR LAYER
.js files
This is where we can change
how the page behaves, adding
interactivity.
HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT
**The JavaScript** is added last
and enhances the usability of
the page or the experience of
interacting with the site.
Keeping it separate means
that the page still works if the
user cannot load or run the
JavaScript.
## How to create **JavaScript file**:
- Create a folder to put then start
 your favorite code edito,A JavaScript file is just a
text file (like HTML and CSS
files are) but it has a . j s file
extension.
- When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML
<script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.
## For example:
*<html>
*<body>
*<hl>Constructive &amp ; Co. </ hl>
*<script src="js/ add-content.js"></ script>
*<p>For all orders and i nquiries please cal l
*<em>SSS-3344</ em></ p>
*</ body>
*</html>
