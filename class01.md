## What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

----

The**HTML code**is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

----
**Attributes Tell Us More About Elements**
Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

# DOCTYPE
each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). 
If you want to** add a comment **to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:

**<!-- comment goes here -->**

 ---
 # ID Attributes
 Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
---
# Class Attributes
Rather than uniquely identifying one element within
a document, you will want a way to identify several elements
as being different from the other elements on the page.
For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your own site and links that point to external sites.

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page.
The **<header>** and **<footer>**elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the site.
● A header or footer for an individual <article> or
<section> within the page.
The<nav> element is used to contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
 the<div> element will remain an important way to
group together related elements, because you should not be using these new elements that you have just met for purposes other than those explicitly stated.

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of 
different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared 
with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
which is available free from Google.

Every website should be designed for the 
target audience—not just for yourself or the 
site owner. It is therefore very important to 
understand who your target audience is.

-------

## when you are creating a new website:
 there is few question you have to answers on them before create your websits:
- **Who is the Site For?**
Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the 
site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is. It can be helpful to ask some 
questions about the people you would expect to be interested in the subject of your site.

-------

- **Why People Visit YOUR Website**
Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While 
some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason .
Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users. 

-------

- **What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve**
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you 
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs. First you want to create a list 
of reasons why people would be coming to your site. 

--------

- **What Information Your Visitors Need**
You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out 
what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

----
- **How Often People Will Visit Your Site**
Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such 
as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

## wireframe 

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key 
information that needs to go on each page of a 
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information 
and how much space it might require.
![wireframe](https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*FVLOt7Tx7P3zPI7T.jpg)

The primary aim of any kind of visual design 
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing 
information on a page helps users understand 
its importance and what order to read it in.

---------
# Visual hierarchy

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find 
information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets 
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for
- size
- color
- style 

**Visual hierarchy** refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what 
they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being 
displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first

---------

## Designing Navigation
Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also 
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. 
Good navigation tends to follow these principles..

-----

It's important to understand who your target audience 
is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you presen
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
 will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
 visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
 using size, color, and style.

# Javascript
a script is a series of intructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the intructions.

-----
**WRITING A SCRIPT**
- To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the 
tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
- Start with the big picture of what 
you want to achieve, and break 
that down into smaller steps.

---
# Designing a script :
* Tasks : once you know the goal of your script,you can work out
the individal tasks needed to achieve it.

* Steps : Each individual may be broken down into  asequence of steps,
when you  are ready to code the script  , these steps can then be
translated into individual lines of code.

Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written 
in a language the computer can understand and follow.

* a script is a series of instructions that the computer can 
follow in order to achieve a goal.
* each time the script  runs , it might only use a subset of all
the instructions.
* computers approuch tasks in a different way than humans, so your 
instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically

## OBJECTS & PROPERTIES
**OBJECTS (TH INGS)** 
In computer programming, each physical thing in 
the world can be represented as an object. There are 
two different types of objects here: a hotel and a car. 
Programmers might say that there is one instance of 
the hotel object, and two instances of the car object. 
Each object can have its own: 
* Properties 
* Events 
* Methods

-----
## PROPERTIES (CHARACTERISTICS) 
Both of the cars share common characteristics. 
In fact, all cars have a make, a color, and engine 
size. You could even determine their current 
speed. Programmers call these characteristics the 
properties of an object. 
Each property has a name and a value, and each of 
these name/value pairs tells you something about 
each individual instance of the object.

## WHAT IS A METHOD? 
Methods typically represent how people (or other 
things) interact with an object in the real world. 
They are like questions and instructions that: 
• Tell you something about that object (using 
information stored in its properties) 
• Change the value of one or more of that object's 
properties.
**When you use a method**?
you do not always need to 
know how it achieves its task; you just need to know 
how to ask the question and how to interpret any 
answers it gives you.

* Using the document object, you can access and change what content 
users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.

# HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

These three layers form the basis of a popular 
approach to building web pages called 
progressive enhancement. 

- CONTENT LAYER 
**. html files**
This is where the content of 
the page lives. The HTML gives 
the page structure and adds 
semantics.

- PRESENTATION LAYER 
**. css files** 
The CSS enhances the HTML 
page with rules that state how 
the HTML content is presented 
(backgrounds, borders, box 
dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

- BEHAVIOR LAYER 
**.js files** 
This is where we can change 
how the page behaves, adding 
interactivity. We will aim to keep 
as much of our JavaScript as 
possible in separate files.

------
**JavaScript** is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not 
need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an 
HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day. 

* When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML 
<script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. 
Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. 

* You may see JavaScript in the HTML between 
opening <script> and closing </script> tags 
(but it is better to put scripts in their own files).

-------------

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript 
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and 
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 

- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages 
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like 
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
 
- If you view the source code of the page in the browser, 
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, 
because the script works with the model of the web 
page that the browser has created.
