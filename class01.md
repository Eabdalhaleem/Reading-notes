## What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

The** HTML code **is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

** Attributes Tell Us More About Elements **
Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

#  DOCTYPE
each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). 
If you want to** add a comment **to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
**<!-- comment goes here -->**

 # ID Attributes
 Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).

# Class Attributes
Rather than uniquely identifying one element within
a document, you will want a way to identify several elements
as being different from the other elements on the page.
For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your own site and links that point to external sites.

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page.
The **<header>** and **<footer> **elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the site.
● A header or footer for an individual <article> or
<section> within the page.
The*<nav>* element is used to contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
The*<article>* element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
 the **<div>** element will remain an important way to
group together related elements, because you should not be using these new elements that you have just met for purposes other than those explicitly stated. 

- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
 will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
 visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
 using size, color, and style.

# Javascript
a script is a series of intructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the intructions.
