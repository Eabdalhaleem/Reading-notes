# lists
## Ordered Lists
<ol>
The ordered list is created with 
the <ol> element.
<li>
Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening <li> tag 
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

----
## Unordered lists
<ul>
The unordered list is created 
with the <ul> element.
<li>
Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening <li> tag 
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.

## Definition Lists
<dl>
The definition list is created with 
the <dl> element and usually 
consists of a series of terms and 
their definitions.
Inside the <dl> element you will 
usually see pairs of <dt> and 
<dd> elements.
<dt>
This is used to contain the term 
being defined (the definition 
term).
<dd>
This is used to contain the 
definition.

##  Box Dimensions(width, height)
enough to hold its contents. To 
set your own dimensions for a 
box you can use the height and 
width properties.
The most popular ways to 
specify the size of a box are 
to use pixels, percentages, or 
ems. Traditionally, pixels have 
been the most popular method 
because they allow designers to 
accurately control their size.

## Limiting Width(min-width, max-width)
Some page designs expand and 
shrink to fit the size of the user's 
screen. In such designs, the 
min-width property specifies 
the smallest size a box can be 
displayed at when the browser 
window is narrow, and the 
max-width property indicates 
the maximum width a box can 
stretch to when the browser 
window is wide.

## Border, Margin & Padding
Every box has three available properties that 
can be adjusted to control its appearance:
- Border:
Every box has a border (even if 
it is not visible or is specified to 
be 0 pixels wide). The border 
separates the edge of one box 
from another.
- Margin:
Margins sit outside the edge 
of the border. You can set the 
width of a margin to create a 
gap between the borders of two 
adjacent boxes.
- Padding:
Padding is the space between 
the border of a box and any 
content contained within it. 
Adding padding can increase the 
readability of its contents

## CREATING AN ARRAY
You create an array and give it
a name just like you would any
other variable (using the var
keyword followed by the name of
the array).
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 
The first lines of code on the left
create an array containing a list
of three colors. (The values can
be added on the same line or on
separate lines as shown here.) 

--------
A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value. 
If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect,
it tries to make sense of the operation rather
than report an error. 
Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript
can be treated as if it were true or false; and
this has some interesting side effects

**Falsy** values are treated as if they
are fa 1 se. The table to the left
shows a hi ghScore variable with
a series of values, all of which
are falsy. 
**Truthy** values are treated as if
they are true. Almost everything
that is not in the falsy table can
be treated as if it were true.

Logical operators are processed left to right.
They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a
result - but they return the value that stopped
the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se). 
Logical operators will not always
return true or false, because:
• They return the value that
stopped processing.
• That value might have been
treated as truthy or falsy
although it was not a Boolean. 

## LOOPS
loop check  a condition , if it return true . a code block will run then the condition will check again
A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array. 
  
Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
