# Introduction to React and Components

## What is a component?

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

-----------

## What are the charactistics of a component?

* **Reusability** − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

* **Replaceable** − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

* **Not context specific** − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

* **Extensible** − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

* **Encapsulated** − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not   expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

* **Independent** − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

# What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

**Ease of deployment** − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

**Reduced cost** − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

**Ease of development** − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

**Reusable** − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

**Modification of technical complexity** − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

**Reliability** − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

**System maintenance and evolution** − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

**Independent** − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

## What is props short for?

Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.
But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

--------

## How are props used in React?

* Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
* Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
* Finally, render the Props Data.

---------

## What is the flow of props?

 Flow is a static type checker for your JavaScript code. It is developed at Facebook and is often used with React. It lets you annotate the variables, functions, and React components with a special type syntax, and catch mistakes early.

 ----------

## What Is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

is a React component class, or React component type. A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render.

In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.

Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. You can learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar

React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to check your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.

## Introducing JSX 

 JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

Why JSX?
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

-----------

## JSX is an Expression Too

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions

------------

## Rendering Elements

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.
An element describes what you want to see on the screen

## Rendering an Element into the DOM

We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render()

## Updating the Rendered Element

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().

## React Only Updates What’s Necessary

React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

-----------

## Components and Props
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.
Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

## Function and Class Components

 function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.
You can also use an ES6 class to define a component

## Rendering a Component
elements can also represent user-defined components, When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”

## Composing Components
Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

## Extracting Components
Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components

## Props are Read-Only
Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.
In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input

All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the next section, we will introduce a new concept of “state”. State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.
