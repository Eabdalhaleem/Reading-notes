## What is a ‘call’?
a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?


## What does LIFO mean?
When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.


Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

## What causes a Stack Overflow?
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

## What is a ‘refrence error’?
This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
This is also a common thing when using const and let, they are hoisted like var and function but there is a time between the hoisting and being declared so when you try to access them a reference error occurs, the fact that this happens to let and const is called Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

## What is a ‘syntax error’?
 this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
 Some syntax errors like sending a trailing comma when calling a function are handled without error by most recent browsers, but older ones you have to be careful.

## What is a ‘range error’?
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.
var foo= []
foo.length = foo.length -1 // Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length

An array for instance cannot have a negative length, why would you mess with the array length? Some people use it to set an array to empty, something of the likes of


## What is a ‘tyep error’?
Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
This is probably the most frequent error in JS, trying to access a property/method thinking that bar is of the type object when in reality, since it hasn’t been declared yet, it’s undefined which doesn’t have any baz available.
The fix is simple, just make sure that bar exists before trying to access it, either by creating bar or by checking for undefined.

## What is a breakpoint?
 is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause.

More generally, a breakpoint is a means of acquiring knowledge about a program during its execution. During the interruption, the programmer inspects the test environment (general purpose registers, memory, logs, files, etc.) to find out whether the program is functioning as expected. In practice, a breakpoint consists of one or more conditions that determine when a program's execution should be interrupted.


## what does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as ‘bugs’) in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. To prevent incorrect operation of a software or system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects. When various subsystems or modules are tightly coupled, debugging becomes harder as any change in one module may cause more bugs to appear in another. Sometimes it takes more time to debug a program than to code it.

To debug a program, user has to start with a problem, isolate the source code of the problem, and then fix it. A user of a program must know how to fix the problem as knowledge about problem analysis is expected. When the bug is fixed, then the software is ready to use.
