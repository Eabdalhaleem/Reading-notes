## what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

render happend first before componentDidMount

## What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
Mounting is the first phase in lifecycle
When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

## Put the following things in the order that they happen:
1- constructor
2- reander
3- componentDidMount
4-React Updates
5-componentWillUnmount

--------------

## What does componentDidMount do?

This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

## What types of things can you pass in the props?


## What is the big difference between props and state?
is props  you pass into component, handeled outside of the component.
state ia handel inside of the component 

## When do we re-render our application?
## What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

## State and Lifecycle
 State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component

 how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second.

 We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks
 misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock.

 Ideally we want to write this once and have the Clock update itself
 To implement this, we need to add “state” to the Clock component.

 ---------

 ## Converting a Function to a Class

You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

* Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
* Add a single empty method to it called render().
* Move the body of the function into the render() method.
* Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
* Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

------------

## Clock is now defined as a class rather than a function.

* The render method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render <Clock /> into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used. This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.

------------


## Adding Local State to a Class

We will move the date from props to state in three steps:

* Replace this.props.date with this.state.date in the render() method
* Add a class constructor that assigns the initial this.state
* Remove the date prop from the <Clock /> element


-------

## Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class

In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.

We want to set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called “mounting” in React.

We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called “unmounting” in React.

We can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts

The **componentDidMount()** method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer

* how we save the timer ID right on this (this.timerID).

While this.props is set up by React itself and this.state has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn’t participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).

We will tear down the timer in the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method

Finally, we will implement a method called tick() that the Clock component will run every second.

It will use this.setState() to schedule updates to the component local state

-------------

## Handling Events

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string

Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting

---------

## Passing Arguments to Event Handlers
Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if id is the row ID


In both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded

------------

# Intro to React

## What Is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component

The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures easier to write. The <div /> syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div')

If you’re curious, createElement() is described in more detail in the API reference, but we won’t be using it in this tutorial. Instead, we will keep using JSX.

JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. You can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.
