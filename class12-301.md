 five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
 
 * SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS);
 * NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

 ------

 * QL databases are table based databases 
 * NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.

 -------

 * SQL databases have predefined schema
 * NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

 ------

 * SQL databases are vertically scalable
 * NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

 -------
 * SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.
 * NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

`Mongoose()`
`Parameters`
`options «Object» see Mongoose#set() docs`
`Mongoose constructor.`

The exports object of the mongoose module is an instance of this class. Most apps will only use this one instance.

Example:

`mongoose instanceof mongoose.Mongoose; // true`

`// Create a new Mongoose instance with its own `connect()`, `set()`, `model()`, etc.`
`const m = new mongoose.Mongoose();`
