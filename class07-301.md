## Who is Roy Fielding?

He was one of the first computer scientists to build HTTP specifications. He helped to write web servers that send documents.
smart person helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
helped write, HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.
is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

## What does a GET do?
GET is used to retrieve and request data from a specified resource in a server
The GET method requests that the target resource transfers a representation of its state. GET requests should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)

## What does a POST do?

The POST method requests that the target resource processes the representation enclosed in the request according to the semantics of the target resource. For example, it is used for posting a message to an Internet forum, subscribing to a mailing list, or completing an online shopping transaction

## What does PUT do?
The PUT method requests that the target resource creates or updates its state with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request.

## What does PATCH do?
The PATCH method requests that the target resource modifies its state according to the partial update defined in the representation enclosed in the request
